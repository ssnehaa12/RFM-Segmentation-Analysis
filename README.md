# RFM-Segmentation-Analysis
For any business, understanding customer behavior and product sales is crucial for survival and 
success, whether it operates online or has a physical location. In this project report, we utilized 
Jupyter Notebook and Python to help an online retail business increase its revenue and profit 
margin by providing valuable insights through customer segmentation and an RFM (Recency, 
Frequency, Monetary) analysis on the dataset. We obtained the dataset from a Kaggle notebook 
sourced through the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 

Analyzing customer data is crucial for businesses to identify the most suitable target audience for 
different advertising strategies. To begin with, we sorted the data and conducted an RFM 
analysis, which helped us extract valuable insights into the ideal customer base. We analyzed 
their activity time, purchase frequency, and spending patterns to identify the most relevant 
customer groups. Finally, we assigned each group an RFM score based on the above parameters 
and determined the appropriate approach. 

We have meticulously cleaned and prepared the dataset obtained from the Kaggle notebook to 
complete this project analysis. Additionally, we have followed a structured and reliable method 
for exploring the dataset using Python's Pandas library on the Jupyter Notebook platform. Our 
ultimate goal is to offer comprehensive and actionable insights on marketing and advertising 
strategies to help the business increase profitability and achieve overall success.
